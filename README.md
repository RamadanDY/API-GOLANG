# API-GOLANG
  
**API-GOLANG** is a RESTful API built with **Go (Golang)** and **MySQL**, designed to demonstrate clean and efficient backend development using Go’s simplicity and performance.

This project follows standard REST API principles and leverages Go’s modular design to handle data operations, request routing, and database communication with MySQL.

### 🔧 Features

* CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* MySQL database integration
* Organized project structure using Go modules
* Follows Clean Architecture principles for maintainability
* JSON-based request and response handling
* Environment-based configuration for easy deployment

### 🏗️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Go (Golang)
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Framework:** net/http or Gin (depending on preference)
* **Architecture:** Clean / Layered Architecture

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `go mod tidy`
3. Configure your `.env` file with database credentials
4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
5. Test the API endpoints using Postman or cURL

### 📚 Future Improvements

* Add JWT authentication
* Implement input validation and middleware
* Add Docker support for containerized deployment

---

**Goal:** Build a simple yet production-ready REST API that demonstrates how to structure backend services in Go with a relational database like MySQL.
